'''
In  the  context  of  object-oriented  programming,  a  protocol  is  an  informal  interface,
defined only in documentation and not in code. For example, the sequence protocol in
Python entails just the __len__ and __getitem__ methods. Any class Spam that imple‚Äê
ments those methods with the standard signature and semantics can be used anywhere
a sequence is expected.
